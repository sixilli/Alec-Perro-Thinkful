# Alec-Perro-Thinkful
Sharing some of my favorite projects that I have completed throughout Thinkful's curriculum.

## Early Projects: Credit Card Fraud and Housing Pricing
Out of my early projects I really enjoyed how these two came out. This area of the curriculum is where I got most of my practice utilizing SK-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. With these tools I practiced general data cleaning, data visualization and predictive modeling.

## Deep Learning: U4 Capstone, MNIST and Cancer Detection
The unit 4 capstone centered around natural language processing. Covering tools such as NLTK and spaCy. Using these tools I was then able to train a classifier that could identify the source material of a paragraph from one of ten Shakespeare plays.

During some of my downtime I took on a few extra projects. The first being Kaggle's MNIST challenge where I learned how to implement Convolutional Neural Networks. The next project used a similar approach when detecting breast cancer in X-rays.

## Finishing Strong: KMeans from Scratch and Final Capstone
Before finishing the program I applied to some jobs. As a pre-screening question I was asked to implement K Means Clustering from scratch. Even though I knew how K Means clustering was done mathematically it proved to be a difficult coding challenge.

The final capstone is currently a work in progress. As it stands I have implemented a fully convolutional neural networks that's very similar to U-Net. I'll be experementing with binary cross entropy with logits loss function with and without dice loss.
