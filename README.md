# Alec-Perro-Thinkful
Sharing some of my favorite projects that I have completed throughout Thinkful's curriculum.

## Early Projects: Credit card fraud and Housing Pricing
Out of my early projects I really enjoyed how these two came out. This area of the curriculum is where I got most of my practice utilizing SK-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. With these tools I learned general data cleaning, data visualization and predictive modeling.

## Deep Learning: U4 Capstone, MNIST and Cancer Detection
The unit 4 capstone centered around natural language processing covering tools such as NLTK and spaCy. Using these tools I was then able to train a classifier that could identify the source material of a paragraph from one of ten Shakespeare plays.

During some of my downtime I took on a few extra projects. THe first being Kaggle's MNIST challenge where I learned how to implement Convolutional Neural Networks. The next project used a similar approach when detecting breast cancer in X-rays.
